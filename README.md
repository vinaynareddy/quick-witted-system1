Safety and Security are the major concerns in modern day era. Homes are frequently left unattended due to complex activities. Most individuals use closed circuit television to protect their homes when they are away from home. These systems are unaware of happenings in the surroundings as they just observe without any detection. It requires human interaction to work properly.


We propose a Quick-Witted Security System using OpenCV. It includes features like Monitoring the theft, Detecting the noise. System also checks the visitors count and updates in and out count. This system comes with an extra feature of face recognition (Using OpenCV) where it identifies image of known and unknown faces by image processing.
